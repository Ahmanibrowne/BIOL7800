```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Here are my fixed code

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 6,]
```

```{r}
mtcars[0:3,]
```

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 8,]
```

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$cyl > 4 | 6, ]
```

2. For this question, the following code is missing 5 values because x is giving a number between 1 to 5 and x is equal to NA which represents all missing values.


3. With the code mtcars[1:15] it doesnt define the columns so the data would have a place to go. With mtcars[1:15, ] it gives the colums its names and the data are able to go to the appropriate locations

4.
The code created two dimensional data of numbers from a vector of data. the code also creates 3 rows and 3 columns.It also uses the is.na() function to check which elements of the data is missing
